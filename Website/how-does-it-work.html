                <h2>1. The Website</h2>
                <p>When loading the page, it sends a SPARQL Query to WikiData and retrieves all infectious 
                    diseases represented in the database. The names of these infectious diseases are stored
                    in the dropdown menu of the search. This ensures that only the infectious diseases
                    included in WikiData are available in the search.</p>
                <br />

                <h2>2. The Disease</h2>
                <p>An infectious disease can be searched by typing letters into the searchbar. All infectious
                    diseases including these letters will subsequently be displayed in the dropdown menu. From 
                    the dropdown menu, one infectious disease can be chosen by clicking on it. This action 
                    sends a second SPARQL Query to WikiData in order to retrieve all symptoms and their 
                    descriptions associated with the selected disease. <br>
                    It is also possible to select a disease by clicking the "Show Example"-button, which chooses
                    a random infectious disease from the dropdown library.
                </p>
                <br />

                <h2>3. The Symptoms</h2>
                <p>All symptoms linked to the selected infectious disease are displayed in form of a wheel. 
                    When clicking on a specific symptom, the wheel will rotate until the symptom is displayed on 
                    the right side of the circle. A discription of the symptom is given in the speech bubble to 
                    the right of the wheel.</p>
                <br />

                <h2>4. The Drugs</h2>
                <p>Next to the discription of the chosen symptom, a button with the option to select the symptom 
                    can be found. When a symptom is selected, a third SPARQL Query is send to WikiData in order to 
                    retrieve the treatments of the chosen symptom. These treatments are displayed in a circle underneath
                    the symptom wheel, where the relative size of the circle indicates the number of available treatments
                    for the selected symptom. The exact number of treatments can be read by hovering over the circle
                    with the mouse. <br>
                    When a second symptom is selected, the drugs to cure it are similarly retrieved from WikiData, 
                    and displayed in a second circle. Drugs that cure both the first and the second selected symptom 
                    are shown in the overlap between the two circles (concept of a Venn Diagram).
                    It is possible to select as many symptoms as there are present in the wheel. When no circle shows up
                    for a selected symptom, no treatments are currently available in the WikiData databse.</p>
