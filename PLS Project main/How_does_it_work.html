            <h2>1. The Website</h2>
            <p>When loading the page, it sends a SPARQL Query to WikiData and retrieves all infectious 
                diseases represented in the database. The names of these infectious diseases are stored
                in the dropdown menu of the search. This ensures that only the infectious diseases
                included in WikiData are available in the search.</p>
            <br />
            <h2>2. The Disease</h2>
            <p>An infectious disease can be searched by typing letters into the searchbar. All infectious
                diseases including these letters will subsequently be displayed in the dropdown menu. From 
                the dropdown menu, one infectious disease can be chosen by clicking on it. This action also 
                sends a second SPARQL Query to WikiData in order to retrieve all symptoms and their 
                descriptions associated with the selected disease.</p>
            <br />
            <h2>3. The Symptoms</h2>
            <p>All symptoms linked to the selected infectious disease are displayed in the shape of a circle. 
                When clicking on a specific symptom, the circle will rotate until the symptom is displayed on 
                the right side of the circle. A discription of the symptom is given in the speech bubble to 
                the right of the circle.</p>
            <br />
            <h2>4. The Drugs</h2>
            <p>Next to the discription of the chosen symptom, a button with the option to select the symptom 
                can be found. When a symptom is selected, a third SPARQL Query is send to WikiData in order to 
                retrieve the drugs that cure the chosen symptom. These drugs are displayed in a circle underneath
                the circle with the symptoms. When a second symptom is selected, the drugs to cure it are 
                similarly retrieved from WikiData, and displayed in a second circle. Drugs that cure both the 
                first and the second selected symptom are shown in the overlap between the two circles (Venn Diagram) 
                A third symptom can be selected and added to the Venn Diagram.</p>
