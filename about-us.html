                    <p>“When I was diagnosed with the vaccinia virus, 
                        I told my doctor that wasn't possible, since I wasn't 
                        vaccinated! Unbeknownst to me, I would suffer from a 
                        myriad of symptoms including necrosis which led to the 
                        loss of limbs. Thanks to X-Check, I was able to get my 
                        limbs back! Thanks, X-Check!” </p>

                and find one or more drugs that treat those side effects. </p>
